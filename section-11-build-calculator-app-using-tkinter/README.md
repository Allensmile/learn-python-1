# Section 11: Build calculator app using tkinter
## Lesson overview
- Python offers multiple options for developing GUI (Graphical User Interface). Out of all the GUI methods, tkinter is most commonly used method. It is a standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit shipped with Python. Python with tkinter outputs the fastest and easiest way to create the GUI applications. Creating a GUI using tkinter is an easy task.
- Basic steps:
    - First we create an object named root out of tk.
    - We create an object of the calc and pass root as master to the init method.
    - Mainloop starts an event loop, which is basically an infinite loop waiting for events and respond accordingly. The mainloop can be terminated by closing the window or using close method.

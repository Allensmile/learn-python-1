## Lesson overview
### IP Address
- IP address: IP or Internet Protocol is a digital address available on any device connected to the network to share data with the Internet connection protocol
- Static IP
    - A static IP address is simply an address that doesn't change. Once your device is assigned a static IP address, that number typically stays the same until the device is decommissioned or your network architecture changes. Static IP addresses generally are used by servers or other important equipment.
- Dynamic IP
    - Dynamic IP addresses are subject to change, sometimes at a moment's notice. Dynamic addresses are assigned, as needed, by Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) servers.
